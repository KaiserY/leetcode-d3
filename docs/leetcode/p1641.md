# 1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings

## Example

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: The 15 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are
["aa","ae","ai","ao","au","ee","ei","eo","eu","ii","io","iu","oo","ou","uu"].
Note that "ea" is not a valid string since 'e' comes after 'a' in the alphabet.
```

## Rust Solution

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn count_vowel_strings(n: i32) -> i32 {
        let mut dp = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1];
        for _ in 1..n {
            for i in 0..4 {
                dp[i] = dp[i..].iter().sum();
            }
        }
        dp.iter().sum()
    }
}
```
